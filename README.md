# jira_watch

A new Flutter project.


# TODO 


## PRIO

### CRITICAL 
 - ✅ [BREAKING] Correct path for saving settings
   - old settings will have to be migrated for users.
 - ✅ fix deprecation of search API

### Base features
 - make asset file containing change log
 - keep track of whether this is the first boot in that version of the app

### EASY, IMPORTANT
 - refresh (per few minutes, or manually)
 - improve user onboarding
   - ✅ input validation
   - ✅ preselect domain to 'Elgato'
   - ✅ [when no project is selected, all is shown] Add a empty project list page to select projects to view

### TOUGH, IMPORTANT
 - mark update as read
 - ticket status
 - flag tkts for meetings 
 - keep filter saved

### EASY, nice
 - assing ticket to me

### TOUGH, nice
 - local favorites (hold a ticket always on top)
 - control ticket status
   - UI/UX make ticket drag and dropable in certain statuses ( e.g In progress, Done , etc)
 - ticket status filter ( bugs features req, stories, epics etc. )
 - comments
 - hide tickets
