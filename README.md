# jira_watch

A new Flutter project.


# TODO 


## PRIO


### CRITICAL
### Base features

### EASY, IMPORTANT
 - refresh (per few minutes, or manually)
 - improve Login page in settings dialog

### TOUGH, IMPORTANT
 - mark update as read
 - ticket status
 - flag tkts for meetings 
 - keep filter saved

### EASY, nice
 - assing ticket to me

### TOUGH, nice
 - local favorites (hold a ticket always on top)
 - control ticket status
   - UI/UX make ticket drag and dropable in certain statuses ( e.g In progress, Done , etc)
 - ticket status filter ( bugs features req, stories, epics etc. )
 - comments
 - hide tickets

## BUGS
 - if project filters are changed before request completes, the newer request is not taken into account
